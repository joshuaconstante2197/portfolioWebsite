      <div class="portfolio-item-individual">

        </p>This app was created for a company I was working with. They used a system called PRISM as their CRM which printed out RPT formatted files in order to manage collections.</p>
        <p>Before I created the app it was necessary to print a report, clean it (since it contained a lot of unnecessary  and often confusing information), format it into a comprehensible excel file, add information from previous weeks and then use it.  This was done at least once a week, took several hours and made it near impossible to stay up to date.</p>
        <p>This app solved various problems in the collections process.</p>
        <li>
            <strong>Time efficiency:</strong>
            <p>Printing, cleaning and formatting the file took hours. With the app it was only necessary to print the file and upload it, the back end takes care of the rest in seconds.</p>
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data persistency and consistency:</strong>
            <p>If they had notes for any particular account from the old file they had to translate them into the new file every time they printed it, this not only added time but the possibility of human error, sometimes resulting in an account being called after they had already paid.</p>
            <p>With the app, any accounts that had notes and were still outstanding will stay on the database, even after a new file is uploaded. Since the app doesn't take hours to have the information ready, it is possible to upload a new updated file every day, making the process much more consistent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insights and management:</strong>
            <p>Previously a manager had to have a meeting every few weeks to get information about the total amount outstanding and which were the accounts that owed the most, if they were being paid off or if there were any complications.</p>
            <p>The app has a metrics page, showing the 10 biggest outstanding accounts, their percentage in relationship with the total amount and the totals of all the accounts divided into how overdue they were.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
